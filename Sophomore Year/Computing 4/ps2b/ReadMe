In this assignment, I took what i made in PS2a and added a physics
simulation to it. New functions were added to calculate x and Y velocity, 
along with new positions to accomidate for them. A step function was created,
and with the parameter "seconds", it was able to calculate new values for
the sprite's location based on all the planets around it. "Seconds" is
a double variable which is the increment of time in the simulation,
which is scanned in as a command line argument, along with the total 
desired runtime of the simulation.
