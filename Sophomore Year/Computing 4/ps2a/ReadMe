/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
In this assignment, classes, smart pointers, and the SFML library were
used to create a model of the solar system. Raw data about each body
along with an image file was loaded into a CelestialBody object, which was
then pointed at by an array of smart pointers in the universe object,
which was displayed by SFML.

  /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/

Some of the key ideas that were central to the assignment include 
classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Describe if and how do you used the smart pointers 
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/

For loading each line of text into an object, the istream operator was 
overloaded, and the data was put into CelestialBody objects. A vector
of smart pointers were used to point at each of these objects. 


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/

none

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/

Small issues with inheritance, along with an issue where overloaded
>> function would not store data properly
